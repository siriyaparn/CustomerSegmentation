# Customer Segmentation
 The objective of this project is to study how to separate customers into groups by using K-mean cluster techniques according to RFM Analysis. RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) model is widely used in many fields, including in the fields of marketing to make strategic choices in the business. Using RFM segmentation, marketers can be able to target particular clusters of clients and target due to their behavior and in this way create much higher rates of customer response, furthermore, expands loyalty and customer lifetime.

## Data Classification
The data classification techniques are RFM analysis and K-mean clustering. RMF is the marketing technique that used to rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency, and monetary total of their transactions to identify the best customers and perform targeted marketing promotion. This technique tries to score customers on each of three factors. A score is given from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest. Then, use the score to perform K-mean clustering is an iterative algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K distinct clusters which this study uses K = 5 as five clusters to group the customers and plan the marketing strategy.
